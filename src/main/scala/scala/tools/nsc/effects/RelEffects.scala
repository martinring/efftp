  /**
   * Returns the relative effects of a method
   * @TODO: document difference to the method relFromAnnotation
   *
   * The relative effect of a method is defined as follows:
   *  - If the method has an explicit return type, the @pure annotations on the return type (if
   *    there are none, the method doesn't have a relative effect)
   *  - If the return type of the method is inferred, the relative effect is that of the next
   *    enclosing method.
   *
   * The implementation of this method is very tricky. The reason is that we cannot find out from
   * a method symbol if it has an inferred type or not.
   *
   *
   * Scenario 1
   * ----------
   *
   *   def foo = {
   *     def bar = 1
   *     bar
   *   }
   *
   * Events (explained in text below)
   *
   *  + fooSym.info                       // Somebody wants the type of `foo`
   *  |-+ computeType(fooBody)            // Namers.typeSig(foo), type completer for foo
   *  | |-+ Namers.enterSym(barSym)       // Typers.typedBlock, statements
   *  | |-+ typed(reference-to-bar)       // Typers.typedBlock, expr
   *  |   |-+ barSym.info                 // Typer asks the type of `barSym`
   *  |   | |-- computeType(barBody)      // Namers.typeSig(bar), type completer for bar
   *  |   | |-+ pluginsTypeSig(bar)       // Finished computing the type of `barBody`, call pluginsTypeSig before assigning to `barSym`
   *  |   | | |-+ computeEffect(barBody)
   *  |   | |   |-- relEffects(barSym)
   * -|---|-|------------------------------- future
   *  |   | |-+ barSym.setType            // replaces the lazy type of barSym
   *  |   |
   *  |   |-+ assign type to reference-to-bar
   *  |
   *  |-+ pluginsTypeSig(foo)
   *  | |-+ computeEffect(fooBody)
   *  |   |-+ relEffects(fooSym)
   *  |
   *  |--+ fooSym.setType                 // replaces the lazy type of fooSym
   *
   *
   *
   * Inferring the type of `foo` triggers type inference for the type of `bar`. This means that in
   * the analyzer plugin, we will first receive a call to `pluginsTypeSig` for symbol `bar`, once
   * its type has been computed by `typeSig` - `bar` is the method whose type is computed first.
   *
   * Since the type of `bar` was inferred, the effects plugin will also infer the effects of the body
   * of `bar`. To do that, we need to know what are the relative effects of `bar` (this information is
   * passed to effect inference in the effect typing context).
   *
   * Therefore there will be an invocation `relEffects(barSym)`. At this point, the symbol for `bar`
   * still has a lazy type: the inferred type will only be assigned to `barSym` *after* `pluginsTypeSig`
   * returns a result. Also the symbol of `foo` will still have a lazy type: the type inference for
   * the body of `foo` is still running.
   *
   * The fact that these two symbols have lazy types when we arrive here indicates that they have an
   * inferred type, which means they also have an inferred effect (if we want to change that, i.e. support
   * an @inferEff annotation, we need to fix things).
   *
   * That explains: if the method symbol passed into `relEffects` has a lazy type, we use the relative
   * effects of the next enclosing method.
   *
   *
   * Scenario 2
   * ----------
   *
   *   def foo: Int = {
   *     def bar = 1
   *     bar
   *   }
   *
   *  + fooSym.info                       // Somebody wants the type of `foo`
   *  |-+ typedType(Int).tpe              // Namers.typeSig(foo)
   *  |-+ pluginsTypeSig(foo)             // call plugins before
   *  | |-+ ---nothing---                 // since type was not inferred, also effects are not inferred. if the return
   *  |                                      type had effect annots they would end up in the resulting type of course.
   *  |-+ fooSym.setType                  // replaces the lazy type
   *
   * --------------------------------------- later, during typer phase
   *
   *  + typedDefDef(foo)
   *  |-+ fooSym.initialize               // if nobody asked for `foo.info` before, will do the above. nothing otherwise
   *  |-+ typed(fooBody)
   *  | |-+ Namers.enterSym(barSym)
   *  | |-+ typed(reference-to-bar)
   *  |   |-+ barSym.info
   *  |   | |-- computeType(barBody)
   *  |   | |-+ pluginsTypeSig(bar)
   *  |   | | |-+ computeEffect(barBody)
   *  |   | |   |-- relEffects(barSym)    // DIFFERENCE TO BEFORE: the enclosing fooSym now has a non-lazy type!!!
   * -|---|-|------------------------------- future
   *  |   | |-+ barSym.setType
   *  |   |
   *  |   |-+ assign type to reference-to-bar
   *  |
   *  |-+ verify that fooBody.tpe <:< foo.tpt
   *
   *
   * Note that `fooSym` *also* has a lazy type initially! Instead of type-checking the body of `foo`,
   * this lazy type will type check the expected type and not touch the body tree.
   *
   * What happens in this case: the body tree of `foo` will only be type-checked during the typer phase.
   * Typing `fooBody` is still the same as before, up to the call to `relEffects`: now the inner `barSym`
   * has a lazy type (we're computing its type / effect) BUT the enclosing `fooSym` has a given type. So
   * `relEffects` will return the `@pure` annotations that are found on `fooSym` (which are none in the exmaple).
   *
   * ------------------
   *
   * INVARIANTS: We make a few assumptions here
   *
   *   1. The completer of an enclosing method is *always* invoked *before* the completer of a nested method.
   *      There are two cases how the inner completer can be invoked:
   *        a. Due to type inference of the enclosing method (first scenario). Then obviously the inner completer
   *           is called later (i.e. within the outer completer)
   *        b. Due to type-checking the outer DefDef. Since typedDefDef calls `initialize` in the beginning, the
   *           outer completer is executed first.
   *
   *   2. An inferred return type always means an inferred effect.
   *
   * ------------------
   *
   * If we want to change the second assumption, i.e. infer effects when there is an explicit return type, a
   * type-check of a body is triggered even if there's an explicit return type. Before that (in pluginsTypeSig),
   * we have the possibility to add an attachment to the outer method symbol and provide some information which
   * could be extracted here. So we could recognize these symbols here and maybe handle them differently.
   *
   *   def foo: Int @infer @pure(x) = { ... }
   *
   * Would trigger effect inference. But before, that, we could assign attach the `@pure` effect to `fooSym`. Then
   * we could still use the annotated relative effect, even thought the `fooSym` still has a lazy type.
   *
   * ------------------
